# Software Memorial


This is a memorial to some of the software and services I've most enjoyed. They are varying degrees of defunct. RIP.

- [PiCloud](http://www.multyvac.com/)
  * PiCloud would automatically serialize your code (and data) and run it on AWS as managed by picloud (making their profit by slightly marking up the CPU time.) It was awesome. The joy of using PiCloud was comparable to the joy of originally learning Python.
- [StarCluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/index.html)
  * StarCluster is only defunct in the sense that it uses very old AMIs that can't update apt-get or install new packages anymore. Still, I couldn't get my recent stuff to run.
  * [Official(?) github repo](https://github.com/jtriley/StarCluster)
  * [My fork](https://github.com/bryan-lunt/StarCluster/)
  * [cancan101 (One of the most active forks)](https://github.com/cancan101/StarCluster)
  * [datacratic (another active fork)](https://github.com/datacratic/StarCluster)
- [TurboLinux]( http://www.turbolinux.com/ )
  * (Not exactly defunct, but far less free than when I was using it. One of the first to support proper Japanese with a decent input method.)
  * When I used it, it was a desktop distro. Actually, my BFF and I built a Beowulf cluster of it when we were 16 years old. When Beowulf was hard. (Get off my lawn!) Good memories.
