abstract = {Since the onset of the genomic era more than 1000 bacterial genomes have been sequenced and several fold more are expected to be completed in the near future. These genome sequences supply a wealth of information that can be exploited by statistical methods to gain significant insights into cellular processes. In Volume 422 of Methods in Enzymology we described a covariance-based method, which was able to identify coevolving residue pairs between the ubiquitous bacterial two-component signal transduction proteins, the sensor kinase and the response regulator. Such residue position pairs supply interaction specificity in the light of highly amplified but structurally conserved two-component systems in a typical bacterium and are enriched with interaction surface residue pairings. In this chapter we describe an extended version of this method, termed “direct coupling analysis” (DCA), which greatly enhances the predictive power of traditional covariance analysis. DCA introduces a statistical inference step to covariance analysis, which allows to distinguish coevolution patterns introduced by direct correlations between two-residue positions, from those patterns that arise via indirect correlations, that is, correlations that are introduced by covariance with other residues in the respective proteins. This method was shown to reliably identify residue positions in spatial proximity within a protein or at the interface between two interaction partners. It is the goal of this chapter to allow an experienced programer to reproduce our techniques and results so that DCA can soon be applied to new targets.}

    abstract = {Predictive understanding of the myriads of signal transduction pathways in a cell is an outstanding challenge of systems biology. Such pathways are primarily mediated by specific but transient protein-protein interactions, which are difficult to study experimentally. In this study, we dissect the specificity of protein-protein interactions governing two-component signaling (TCS) systems ubiquitously used in bacteria. Exploiting the large number of sequenced bacterial genomes and an operon structure which packages many pairs of interacting TCS proteins together, we developed a computational approach to extract a molecular interaction code capturing the preferences of a small but critical number of directly interacting residue pairs. This code is found to reflect physical interaction mechanisms, with the strongest signal coming from charged amino acids. It is used to predict the specificity of TCS interaction: Our results compare favorably to most available experimental results, including the prediction of 7 (out of 8 known) interaction partners of orphan signaling proteins in Caulobacter crescentus. Surveying among the available bacterial genomes, our results suggest 15∼25% of the TCS proteins could participate in out-of-operon “crosstalks”. Additionally, we predict clusters of crosstalking candidates, expanding from the anecdotally known examples in model organisms. The tools and results presented here can be used to guide experimental studies towards a system-level understanding of two-component signaling.},

	abstract = {Background Estrogen Receptor α (ERα) is a major lineage determining transcription factor (TF) in mammary gland development, orchestrating the expression of thousands of genes. Dysregulation of ERα-mediated transcriptional program results in abnormal cell proliferation and cancer. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of breast cancer cell lines has revealed large numbers of enhancers involved in this regulatory program, but how these enhancers encode function in their sequence remains poorly understood.Results A subset of ERα-bound enhancers are transcribed into short bidirectional RNA (enhancer RNA or eRNA), and this property is believed to be a reliable marker of active enhancers. We therefore analyze thousands of ERα-bound enhancers and build quantitative, mechanism-aware models to discriminate eRNAs from non-transcribing enhancers based on their sequence. Our thermodynamics-based models provide insights into the roles of specific TFs in ERα-mediated transcriptional program, many of which are supported by the literature. We use in silico perturbations to predict TF-enhancer regulatory relationships and integrate these findings with experimentally determined enhancer-promoter interactions to construct a gene regulatory network. We also demonstrate that the model can prioritize breast cancer-related sequence variants while providing mechanistic explanations for their function. Finally, we experimentally validate the model-proposed mechanisms underlying three such variants.Conclusions We modeled the sequence-to-expression relationship in ERα-driven enhancers and gained mechanistic insights into the workings of a major transcriptional program. Our model is consistent with the current body of knowledge and its predictions are confirmed by experimental observations. We believe this to be a promising approach to analysis of regulatory sequences and variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to predict the impact of small genetic changes such as single nucleotide polymorphisms on gene expression, since mechanisms involved in gene regulation and their cis-regulatory encoding are not well-understood. Recent studies have attempted to predict the functional impact of non-coding variants based on available knowledge of cis-regulatory encoding, e.g., transcription factor (TF) motifs. In this work, we explore the relationship between regulatory variants and cis-regulatory encoding from the opposite angle, using the former to inform the latter. We employ sequence-to-expression modeling to resolve ambiguities regarding gene regulatory mechanisms using information about effects of single nucleotide variations in an enhancer. We demonstrate our methodology using a well-studied enhancer of the developmental gene intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind) in D. melanogaster. We first trained the thermodynamics-based model GEMSTAT to relate the neuroectodermal expression pattern of ind to its enhancer{\textquoteright}s sequence, and constructed an ensemble of models that represent different parameter settings consistent with available data for this gene. We then predicted the effects of every possible single nucleotide variation within this enhancer, and compared these to SNP data recorded in the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel. We chose specific SNPs for which different models in the ensemble made conflicting predictions, and tested their effect in vivo. These experiments narrowed in on one mechanistic model as capable of explaining the observed effects. We further confirmed the generalizability of this model to orthologous enhancers and other related developmental enhancers. In conclusion, mechanistic models of cis-regulatory function not only help make specific predictions of variant impact, they may also be learned more accurately using data on variants.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE A central issue in analyzing variations in the non-coding genome is to interpret their functional impact, and their connections to phenotype differences and disease etiology. Machine learning methods based on statistical modeling have been developed to associate genetic variants to expression changes. However, associations predicted by these models may not be functionally relevant, despite being statisticaly significant. We describe how mathematical modeling of gene expression can be employed to systematically study the non-coding sequence and its relationship to gene expression. We demonstrate our method in a well studied developmental enhancer of the fruitfly. We establish the efficacy of mathematical models in combination with the polymorphism data to reveal new mechanistic insights.},

	abstract = {Understanding of the gene regulatory activity of enhancers is a major problem in regulatory biology. The nascent field of sequence-to-expression modelling seeks to create quantitative models of gene expression based on regulatory DNA (cis) and cellular environmental (trans) contexts. All quantitative models are defined partially by numerical parameters, and it is common to fit these parameters to data provided by existing experimental results. However, the relative paucity of experimental data appropriate for this task, and lacunae in our knowledge of all components of the systems, results in problems often being under-specified, which in turn may lead to a situation where wildly different model parameterizations perform similarly well on training data. It may also lead to models being fit to the idiosyncrasies of the training data, without representing the more general process (overfitting).In other contexts where parameter-fitting is performed, it is common to apply regularization to reduce overfitting. We systematically evaluated the efficacy of three types of regularization in improving the generalizability of trained sequence-to-expression models. The evaluation was performed in two types of cross-validation experiments: one training on D. melanogaster data and predicting on orthologous enhancers from related species, and the other cross-validating between four D. melanogaster neurogenic ectoderm enhancers, which are thought to be under control of the same transcription factors. We show that training with a combination of noise-injection, L1, and L2 regularization can drastically reduce overfitting and improve the generalizability of learned sequence-to-expression models. These results suggest that it may be possible to mitigate the tendency of sequence-to-expression models to overfit available data, thus improving predictive power and potentially resulting in models that provide better insight into underlying biological processes.},
